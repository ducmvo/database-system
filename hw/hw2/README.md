**CHAPTER 2**

- After you get the business rules from the customer, describe steps you would use in creating an ERM? (1 point)
  Create a mission statement.
  Really understand all the rules and requirements.
  `      `Know the business pain point
  `      `Understand what data need to be captured
  Determine who are the right people using the system
- Why is the ERM effective in creating a relational database? (1 point)

Entity Relational Model has structural independence promoted using independent tables. Its tabular view improves conceptual simplicity. The ad hoc query capability is based on SQL. It also isolates the end user from physical-level details and improves implementation and management simplicity.

- What is a simple example of a one to many relationship (describe it. You don't need to submit a diagram) (1 point)

Owner – Pet is an example of one to many. One owner can have many pet, and one pet belongs to one owner.

Customer – Order is another example. One customer can make many orders, and one order belongs to one customer

- What is a simple example of a many to many relationship (describe it. You don't need to submit a diagram) (1 point)

Playlist – Song, 1 playlist has many songs and 1 song can be in many playlist

- Create a ERD For the following tables (Courses, Class, Enroll, and Student). You can use your book's example. Please submit diagram (2 points)

- Create an ERD based for the XYZ company based on these rules (You don't need to include attributes, Primary keys. I would encourage you to do it on paper and upload image into your answer, as it will take you far less time than doing it in MYSQL) (3 points)
  - Each sales rep generates multiple orders
  - Each order is written by one sales rep
  - Each sales rep belongs to one department
  - Each customer generates multiple orders

**CHAPTER 3**

- What is the difference between a database and a table?  (1 point)

A table is an object inside a database. It is perceived as a 2-dimentional structure composed of rows and columns. A database is a collection of many components like tables and indexes

- A data dictionary is often referred to as "Data about Data". What does that mean? (One paragraph minimum) (1 point)

A data dictionary is a collection of detailed information about the databases. It’s often called metadata. It describes the data characteristics and the set of relationships that links the data found within the database. For example, it can hold the name, types of elements, can be empty, and more. Because of this, metadata is extremely important in databases, and a database can even be described as a 'collection of self-describing data' because of how important metadata is.

- A database index is useful because ...? (1 point)

An index is an orderly arrangement used to logically access rows in a table. It gives users more efficient ways to find specific rows in tables.

**CHAPTER 4**

- Describe what a strong relationship means. Use an example (Note: You don't have to submit a diagram) (1 point) 

Strong relationship is also known as an identifying relationship. It occurs when the primary key of one participant contains a primary key component of the other participant.

- Create the following ERD (Write all relationships and cardinalities) (8  points)
  - A department employs many employees. Each employee is employed by one department (except for Rover's which aren't assigned to any department
  - A division operates many departments, but each department is operated by only one division
  - An employee may be assigned to many projects, and a project may have many employees assigned to it.
  - A project must have at least one employee assigned to it
  - One of the employees manages each department, and each department is managed by only one employee
  - One of the employees runs each division, and each division is run by only one employee.

Special HW Problem (5 points)

- You will go to this site for the [Lahman baseball data (Links to an external site.)](http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics/) , and select 2019 (MYSQL). It will direct you to a web site in which you will have to save the output to a script file that you will load into your personal MYSQL database. This script on the web site creates your database, so you shouldn't have to do anything but open it and run it. It will create EVERYTHING (tables, primary keys, foreign keys,data , ....)
- After creating database, you will want to "Reverse Engineer" it into a Model. Instructor has gone over this in class.
- After you go to the model for Lahman, I would like you to "make it look pretty". Here is what you need to do
- Make sure that no Lines overlap (Move them around)
- Make sure related tables are close together. It should look "pretty"
- Try to provide some captions to the relationships (We have covered this in class). Do at least 5 of these captions
- Experiment with the Optional/Mandatory participation in the relationship. If you think you know what is optional/mandatory please set it.
- Create an additional entity called SocialMedia. This entity describes the various social media accounts a "person" might have. Example (Twitter, Facebook, ...). A "Person" can have 0 to many SocialMedia records. Please create relationship between Person and SocialMedia.
- Save the Model, and do a screen shot of your model. Embed it into the answer.
