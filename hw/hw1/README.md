\1. Make a list of at least 10 different data sources that you interact with on a frequent basis (1 point)

- Facebook.com
- Youtube.com
- Linkedln.com
- Medium.com
- Komonews.com
- Reddit.com
- Instagram.com
- Udemy.com
- Amazon.com
- Seattleu.edu


\2. Please list the members of your Project Team, and who is the group leader. Please come up a Project that you would like to develop. Explain why it is interesting. You don't have to have too many data requirements defined yet as that will be the next two weeks) (1 point)

Team:

- Khanh Le – Leader
- Duc Vo
- Jou Ho
- Sam Farmer

Project Idea:

An application used to streamline scheduling and appointments at a veterinary clinic. 
It is hard to setup an appointment by calling in and asking for an available time. We will develop a web application where customers could search and choose a vet clinic, see available times, and setup appointments in advance.

\3. Answer the following questions. You should not have to go beyond one paragraph for each question. Note: Please put it into your own words (NO Google/Wikipedia or "book answers"). Use example when appropriate. (one point each) (4 points)

a. Could a "file" (e.g. Excel file) be considered a Database? Why or Why not? (1 paragraph minimum)

A file could be considered a database since it could be used to stored and organized data in a structured way. The file data could be electronically accessed with CRUD operations through a computer software or application. However, it is very difficult and inefficient when organizing large amount of data and their relationship.



b. What is data redundancy?  Provide an example (one paragraph minimum)

Bad data modeling design is one of the factors that causes data redundancy. Duplicated data found in many places leads to data anomalies. For example, if one insurance policy table have 10 different customers holding the same policy with the same premium price. If we want to change the premium price for this policy, we must update all the rows (10 rows) that stored the price of this policy.

c. Why is Database Design important? (1 paragraph minimum)

Database design is important because it increase efficiency and speed in accessing and storing data. Bad design is costly when data grow since it reduces speed and requires more storage, computing resources, etc. Good database design brings a lot of values since it helps with scalability, cost reduction, and saving resources

d. Draw a simple diagram showing what structured data might look like? Do the same for unstructured data.  (Use diagrams and your own examples, and explain why is is structured or unstructured)

Structure Data: Data is organized into entities. Relationships between entities are established.

Unstructured Data: cannot be display in rows or columns. No relationship
